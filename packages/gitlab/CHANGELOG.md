# @goodfellow-cms/gitlab

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1bfecf7: Publishing to GitHub and GitLab. New `@goodfellow-cms/github` and `@goodfellow-cms/gitlab` backends edit a site's repository straight from the browser: GitHub with an access token from a prefilled link, GitLab with one-click OAuth (PKCE) or a token. Set `backend` in `goodfellow.config.tsx` and `goodfellow build` includes the admin panel at `/admin/`, with a sign-in screen, an account menu and a live-site status that follows the deploy after each publish. `@goodfellow-cms/core` adds the `GitHost` and `GitBackend` interfaces, `writeChanges()` (which saves over other people's changes to other files but never the same ones), and `@goodfellow-cms/core/testing` with an in-memory repository for fakes. `goodfellow dev` gives each site its own Vite cache and keeps watching content when folders are replaced.
- ece9ba5: The media library. A new **Media** screen uploads, replaces and deletes images and files in `public/media/`, saying where a file is used before deleting it. Image fields in blocks, page settings, collection items and site settings get a **Choose image** button that picks from the library or uploads a new file. Large photos are shrunk, JPEGs lose hidden details such as location, SVGs lose scripts, and only file types that can't run code are accepted. Previews show new uploads straight away, and add the site's base path to media addresses. `FileChange` can now carry `bytes`, and every store implements `readBytes()`, with both backends, their fakes and the development server supporting uploads. `@goodfellow-cms/react` adds `mediaField()`, used by the Image and Section blocks, and the AI assistant is told which images the site has.

### Patch Changes

- fd6f851: Blocks from block registries. The admin panel has a **Blocks** screen that adds blocks built with shadcn/ui to the editor, and removes them, with no developer: adding one publishes its code into the site's `blocks/installed/` and the shadcn components it uses into `components/ui/`, in one commit, and the editor offers it once the site has been rebuilt. Removing a block is refused while content uses it, and keeps files someone has changed.
  
  `@goodfellow-cms/registry` is Goodfellow's registry, with nine blocks: Hero, Cards, Call to action, Testimonials, Notice, Pricing table, FAQ, Tabs and Image carousel. Its README documents the format for registries of blocks built with other libraries, which a site offers once its config lists them in `registries`.
  
  `create-goodfellow` starts new sites with the recommended blocks, or with `--blocks built-in` the built-in blocks only. `@goodfellow-cms/core` plans installs and removals (`planInstall()`, `planRemove()`), and its stores and the GitLab backend read and write the folders installed blocks use. `goodfellow dev` and `next dev` serve the site's copy of the registry, and `goodfellow` resolves `@/` imports from the site's root, as shadcn code expects. `@goodfellow-cms/react`'s theme adds the colors shadcn components use, such as `card` and `destructive`.
- 4ca2dc1: Every package has a README, keywords and links to its documentation, repository and issues, for its page on npm. All the packages are released together with the same version.
- d91eea1: The packages are published under the `@goodfellow-cms` scope on npm, such as `@goodfellow-cms/core` and `@goodfellow-cms/react`, since `@goodfellow` was taken. `goodfellow` and `create-goodfellow` keep their names, and the block registry's name in `components.json` and refs such as `@goodfellow/shadcn-faq` stays `@goodfellow`.
