# @goodfellow-cms/blocks

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5492e22: Collections and templates. A collection, such as videos or events, lives in `content/collections/<name>/`: a `_collection.json` with its fields, an address pattern such as `/videos/{slug}` and a Puck template, plus one file per item. `goodfellow build` and `goodfellow dev` give every item a page from its collection's template, where `{field}` placeholders and the new template-only Entry field block show the item's values. The new Collection list block shows a collection's items on any page, as a list or cards, newest first, upcoming only, and so on. The admin panel has a Collections screen for creating collections, editing their fields and page design, and adding, editing, renaming and deleting items. `@goodfellow-cms/core` adds `allPages()`, `findEntry()` and the collection schemas; `@goodfellow-cms/react` adds a `template` Puck config, `templateOnly()` and `applyEntry()`.
- 652b180: Markdown collections, code highlighting, search and blocks for documentation sites.
  
  - **Markdown collections:** a collection can store its items as Markdown files (`markdown: { body }` in its settings), with the other fields as YAML front matter. The admin panel's collection settings turn it on and convert every item; the body is edited in the formatted editor or a Markdown tab, and Markdown the formatted editor can't show, such as a table, is edited as Markdown only. `@goodfellow-cms/core` adds `parseMarkdownEntry()`, `serializeMarkdownEntry()`, `markdownToHtml()`, `markdownParts()`, `markdownHeadings()` and `canFormatMarkdown()`; HTML in Markdown is shown as text, and only safe addresses are kept.
  - **Code block:** code highlighted with Shiki when the site is built, with a title and a copy button. Code in Markdown text is highlighted too.
  - **Search block:** searches the site in the visitor's browser with Pagefind. Builds index a site only when a page has a search block (`data-goodfellow-search`); `goodfellow build` does it, `goodfellow index` indexes any built site, and Next.js sites run `goodfellow-next index out` after `next build`. Pages mark their main content for indexing.
  - **Collection navigation**, **Previous and next** and **On this page** blocks, for documentation and other sites with ordered collections.
  - Formatted text styles tables, images and code.
- ece9ba5: The media library. A new **Media** screen uploads, replaces and deletes images and files in `public/media/`, saying where a file is used before deleting it. Image fields in blocks, page settings, collection items and site settings get a **Choose image** button that picks from the library or uploads a new file. Large photos are shrunk, JPEGs lose hidden details such as location, SVGs lose scripts, and only file types that can't run code are accepted. Previews show new uploads straight away, and add the site's base path to media addresses. `FileChange` can now carry `bytes`, and every store implements `readBytes()`, with both backends, their fakes and the development server supporting uploads. `@goodfellow-cms/react` adds `mediaField()`, used by the Image and Section blocks, and the AI assistant is told which images the site has.
- de03c18: Add `@goodfellow-cms/next`, which puts a Goodfellow site in a Next.js app, exported as static files. Pages render as Server Components; blocks' links to the site's pages use `next/link` and images `next/image`, sites can be served from a subfolder (`basePath` or `GOODFELLOW_BASE`), and blocks can render Client Components with any hooks. In `next dev` the admin panel saves to the files on disk. `create-goodfellow` can start from a Next.js version of the starter (`--template next`).
  
  `@goodfellow-cms/react` gains a Server Components version (picked through the `react-server` condition), `preparePage()`, and `SiteLink` and `SiteImage`, which blocks use for links and images so they follow the site's base path and the renderer's components. The built-in blocks use them. `@goodfellow-cms/core` gains `withBase()`, `applyBasePath()` and `imageSize()`, and `@goodfellow-cms/core/node` reading sites from disk, image sizes, the local file store and the development API.
- 8c69eb5: Add `create-goodfellow`, which creates a new site from the starter or the parish example (`npm create goodfellow@latest my-site`), and can set up where the site is stored and hosted. Sites can now keep their contact details (address, phone and email) in Site settings, shown wherever the new Contact details block is placed. A collection's link fields can choose an uploaded file, such as a PDF.
- cff2c58: Static rendering. `goodfellow build` turns a site's `content/` folder into static HTML, with Tailwind CSS built from the class names used in content, a sitemap, and support for serving from a subfolder. `goodfellow dev` re-renders pages as content changes, and `goodfellow preview` serves the built site. Includes the content file format (with versioning and migrations), the page renderer, and ten built-in blocks.

### Patch Changes

- 536f2a8: License under MIT.
- 04fc203: The Next.js starter shows the header and footer in a layout (`app/(site)/layout.tsx`, from `goodfellowPages().Layout`), so they stay as they are when moving between pages, and pages only send their own content. `@goodfellow-cms/react` exports `PageHeader`, `PageContent`, `PageFooter` and `prepareLayout()`. Menu marks current links with `data-current` and `aria-current`, which Next.js's layout sets in the browser, since it doesn't know the current page. In `next dev`, `withGoodfellow()` turns off React's debug channel, which made the browser's memory grow to gigabytes with the header and footer in a layout.
- 4ca2dc1: Every package has a README, keywords and links to its documentation, repository and issues, for its page on npm. All the packages are released together with the same version.
- d91eea1: The packages are published under the `@goodfellow-cms` scope on npm, such as `@goodfellow-cms/core` and `@goodfellow-cms/react`, since `@goodfellow` was taken. `goodfellow` and `create-goodfellow` keep their names, and the block registry's name in `components.json` and refs such as `@goodfellow/shadcn-faq` stays `@goodfellow`.
- 3a4c60d: `cx()` now resolves conflicting Tailwind classes with tailwind-merge, so CSS classes added to a block in the editor override the block's own styles.
