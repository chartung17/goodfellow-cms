# @goodfellow-cms/admin

The admin panel: the visual editor for a site's pages, collections, media, header and footer, and settings, which publishes to the site's repository from the browser.

It's built with each site's own config, so the editor always has the site's blocks: `goodfellow build` adds it at `/admin`, and Next.js sites render `GoodfellowAdmin` from `@goodfellow-cms/next` there.

[Goodfellow](https://github.com/goodfellow-cms/goodfellow-cms) is a website builder for people who aren't developers, with no server or database: pages are files in your own GitHub or GitLab repository, edited in a visual editor built on [Puck](https://puckeditor.com). To start a new site, run `npm create goodfellow@latest my-site`. See the [documentation](https://goodfellow-cms.github.io/goodfellow-cms/) for everything else.
