### Minor Changes

- fd6f851: Blocks from block registries. The admin panel has a **Blocks** screen that adds blocks built with shadcn/ui to the editor, and removes them, with no developer: adding one publishes its code into the site's `blocks/installed/` and the shadcn components it uses into `components/ui/`, in one commit, and the editor offers it once the site has been rebuilt. Removing a block is refused while content uses it, and keeps files someone has changed.
  
  `@goodfellow-cms/registry` is Goodfellow's registry, with nine blocks: Hero, Cards, Call to action, Testimonials, Notice, Pricing table, FAQ, Tabs and Image carousel. Its README documents the format for registries of blocks built with other libraries, which a site offers once its config lists them in `registries`.
  
  `create-goodfellow` starts new sites with the recommended blocks, or with `--blocks built-in` the built-in blocks only. `@goodfellow-cms/core` plans installs and removals (`planInstall()`, `planRemove()`), and its stores and the GitLab backend read and write the folders installed blocks use. `goodfellow dev` and `next dev` serve the site's copy of the registry, and `goodfellow` resolves `@/` imports from the site's root, as shadcn code expects. `@goodfellow-cms/react`'s theme adds the colors shadcn components use, such as `card` and `destructive`.
- 2af75b7: Site settings has a Code tab for code from services such as Google Analytics: "In the page head" (script, style, link, meta, base and noscript tags, read with `parseHeadCode()`) and "At the end of the page" (any HTML), saved as `content/code/head.html` and `content/code/body.html`. `goodfellow build` and Next.js add it to every page with `HeadCode` and `BodyCode`; it never runs in the admin panel.
- 88ac239: Demo mode. A site whose config sets `demo: true` opens its admin panel to anyone, with no sign-in and a banner saying it's a demo. Visitors can try everything editors can, but nothing is published: Publish saves their changes, uploads included, in their own browser (IndexedDB), where they stay until the visitor clicks Start over. The Blocks screen lists blocks without adding or removing them.
  
  The demo starts from a copy of the site's content that builds include at `/admin/demo-content.json`, so no git host is called and the repository can stay private. `goodfellow build` writes it, along with the admin panel, for demo sites; Next.js sites serve it with `demoContent` from `goodfellowPages()`, in a new `app/admin/demo-content.json/route.ts`. `@goodfellow-cms/core` adds `demoContent()`, `demoStore()` and the config's `demo` option.
- 652b180: Markdown collections, code highlighting, search and blocks for documentation sites.
  
  - **Markdown collections:** a collection can store its items as Markdown files (`markdown: { body }` in its settings), with the other fields as YAML front matter. The admin panel's collection settings turn it on and convert every item; the body is edited in the formatted editor or a Markdown tab, and Markdown the formatted editor can't show, such as a table, is edited as Markdown only. `@goodfellow-cms/core` adds `parseMarkdownEntry()`, `serializeMarkdownEntry()`, `markdownToHtml()`, `markdownParts()`, `markdownHeadings()` and `canFormatMarkdown()`; HTML in Markdown is shown as text, and only safe addresses are kept.
  - **Code block:** code highlighted with Shiki when the site is built, with a title and a copy button. Code in Markdown text is highlighted too.
  - **Search block:** searches the site in the visitor's browser with Pagefind. Builds index a site only when a page has a search block (`data-goodfellow-search`); `goodfellow build` does it, `goodfellow index` indexes any built site, and Next.js sites run `goodfellow-next index out` after `next build`. Pages mark their main content for indexing.
  - **Collection navigation**, **Previous and next** and **On this page** blocks, for documentation and other sites with ordered collections.
  - Formatted text styles tables, images and code.
- 04fc203: The Next.js starter shows the header and footer in a layout (`app/(site)/layout.tsx`, from `goodfellowPages().Layout`), so they stay as they are when moving between pages, and pages only send their own content. `@goodfellow-cms/react` exports `PageHeader`, `PageContent`, `PageFooter` and `prepareLayout()`. Menu marks current links with `data-current` and `aria-current`, which Next.js's layout sets in the browser, since it doesn't know the current page. In `next dev`, `withGoodfellow()` turns off React's debug channel, which made the browser's memory grow to gigabytes with the header and footer in a layout.
- ebe8d1d: `goodfellow-next finish out`, which the Next.js starter's build script now runs after `next build`, writes the search index as `goodfellow-next index` does, and on Windows moves Next.js's prefetch files to where browsers ask for them. Next.js 16 writes them into `__next.…` folders there, so every prefetch while moving between pages was "not found". `fixSegmentFiles()` is exported from `@goodfellow-cms/next/export`.
- de03c18: Add `@goodfellow-cms/next`, which puts a Goodfellow site in a Next.js app, exported as static files. Pages render as Server Components; blocks' links to the site's pages use `next/link` and images `next/image`, sites can be served from a subfolder (`basePath` or `GOODFELLOW_BASE`), and blocks can render Client Components with any hooks. In `next dev` the admin panel saves to the files on disk. `create-goodfellow` can start from a Next.js version of the starter (`--template next`).
  
  `@goodfellow-cms/react` gains a Server Components version (picked through the `react-server` condition), `preparePage()`, and `SiteLink` and `SiteImage`, which blocks use for links and images so they follow the site's base path and the renderer's components. The built-in blocks use them. `@goodfellow-cms/core` gains `withBase()`, `applyBasePath()` and `imageSize()`, and `@goodfellow-cms/core/node` reading sites from disk, image sizes, the local file store and the development API.

### Patch Changes

- 4ca2dc1: Every package has a README, keywords and links to its documentation, repository and issues, for its page on npm. All the packages are released together with the same version.
- d91eea1: The packages are published under the `@goodfellow-cms` scope on npm, such as `@goodfellow-cms/core` and `@goodfellow-cms/react`, since `@goodfellow` was taken. `goodfellow` and `create-goodfellow` keep their names, and the block registry's name in `components.json` and refs such as `@goodfellow/shadcn-faq` stays `@goodfellow`.
