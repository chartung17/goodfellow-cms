# create-goodfellow

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fd6f851: Blocks from block registries. The admin panel has a **Blocks** screen that adds blocks built with shadcn/ui to the editor, and removes them, with no developer: adding one publishes its code into the site's `blocks/installed/` and the shadcn components it uses into `components/ui/`, in one commit, and the editor offers it once the site has been rebuilt. Removing a block is refused while content uses it, and keeps files someone has changed.
  
  `@goodfellow-cms/registry` is Goodfellow's registry, with nine blocks: Hero, Cards, Call to action, Testimonials, Notice, Pricing table, FAQ, Tabs and Image carousel. Its README documents the format for registries of blocks built with other libraries, which a site offers once its config lists them in `registries`.
  
  `create-goodfellow` starts new sites with the recommended blocks, or with `--blocks built-in` the built-in blocks only. `@goodfellow-cms/core` plans installs and removals (`planInstall()`, `planRemove()`), and its stores and the GitLab backend read and write the folders installed blocks use. `goodfellow dev` and `next dev` serve the site's copy of the registry, and `goodfellow` resolves `@/` imports from the site's root, as shadcn code expects. `@goodfellow-cms/react`'s theme adds the colors shadcn components use, such as `card` and `destructive`.
- de03c18: Add `@goodfellow-cms/next`, which puts a Goodfellow site in a Next.js app, exported as static files. Pages render as Server Components; blocks' links to the site's pages use `next/link` and images `next/image`, sites can be served from a subfolder (`basePath` or `GOODFELLOW_BASE`), and blocks can render Client Components with any hooks. In `next dev` the admin panel saves to the files on disk. `create-goodfellow` can start from a Next.js version of the starter (`--template next`).
  
  `@goodfellow-cms/react` gains a Server Components version (picked through the `react-server` condition), `preparePage()`, and `SiteLink` and `SiteImage`, which blocks use for links and images so they follow the site's base path and the renderer's components. The built-in blocks use them. `@goodfellow-cms/core` gains `withBase()`, `applyBasePath()` and `imageSize()`, and `@goodfellow-cms/core/node` reading sites from disk, image sizes, the local file store and the development API.
- 8c69eb5: Add `create-goodfellow`, which creates a new site from the starter or the parish example (`npm create goodfellow@latest my-site`), and can set up where the site is stored and hosted. Sites can now keep their contact details (address, phone and email) in Site settings, shown wherever the new Contact details block is placed. A collection's link fields can choose an uploaded file, such as a PDF.

### Patch Changes

- 4ca2dc1: Every package has a README, keywords and links to its documentation, repository and issues, for its page on npm. All the packages are released together with the same version.
- d91eea1: The packages are published under the `@goodfellow-cms` scope on npm, such as `@goodfellow-cms/core` and `@goodfellow-cms/react`, since `@goodfellow` was taken. `goodfellow` and `create-goodfellow` keep their names, and the block registry's name in `components.json` and refs such as `@goodfellow/shadcn-faq` stays `@goodfellow`.
- df8bdd0: Sites created with `create-goodfellow` leave out their README's note about working inside the Goodfellow repository.
