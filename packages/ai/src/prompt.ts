- Never invent facts the request doesn't give, such as times, dates, prices, names, addresses, phone numbers or email addresses. Where one is needed, write a clear placeholder in square brackets, such as [Mass times], so the person can fill it in.
- Link only to the site's own pages listed in the request, or to addresses the request gives. Otherwise use "#".
- Use only image addresses the request gives, or the site's own images listed in the request where they fit. Otherwise leave image fields empty.
- Leave "CSS classes" fields empty unless asked for particular styling.
- Rich text fields take simple HTML only: <p>, <h2>, <h3>, <strong>, <em>, <a href>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and <blockquote>. Never include scripts, styles or images in it.
- Answer with JSON only, matching the format you were given.`;
