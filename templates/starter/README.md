# My site

A website built with [Goodfellow](https://github.com/goodfellow-cms/goodfellow-cms). Pages are files in `content/`, edited in the admin panel at `/admin`, and published to a free static host.

## Working on the site

<!-- goodfellow-repository -->
> **In the Goodfellow repository**, this folder is part of a pnpm workspace, so `npm install` doesn't work here. From the repository's root, run `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` (get pnpm with `corepack enable`, or `npm install -g pnpm`), then `pnpm dev` in this folder. The `npm` commands below are for a site of your own, created with `npm create goodfellow`, which leaves this note out.
<!-- /goodfellow-repository -->

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # site at http://localhost:4321, admin panel at http://localhost:4321/admin
npm run build    # builds the site into dist/
npm run preview  # serves dist/
```

On your own computer, the admin panel saves straight to the files in `content/`.

More blocks, such as an FAQ, tabs and a pricing table, can be added on the admin panel's **Blocks** screen, which publishes their code into `blocks/installed/` and the shadcn components they use into `components/ui/`. See [Add blocks](https://goodfellow-cms.github.io/goodfellow-cms/docs/add-blocks).

To add blocks of your own, write React components and add them to `blocks` in `goodfellow.config.tsx`. Parts that respond to visitors, such as a button that shows more, go in a file starting with `"use client"`, and only pages that use them load JavaScript: see [Interactive blocks](https://goodfellow-cms.github.io/goodfellow-cms/docs/interactive-blocks).

The News page and its stories are an example of a collection: a group of similar items that share one page design. Change it or delete it under **Collections** in the admin panel.

## Putting the site online

Setup takes four steps. It's done once, usually by whoever set up the site.

### 1. Store the site on GitHub or GitLab

Create an empty repository on GitHub or GitLab, without a README, and push this folder to it:

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-name/your-site.git   # unless origin is already set
git push -u origin main
```

`create-goodfellow` makes the new site a git repository on the branch `main`, with everything, `package-lock.json` included, in its first commit, and sets `origin` when it's given the repository. Commit any changes since (`git add -A` and `git commit`) before pushing.

### 2. Tell Goodfellow where the site is stored

If you gave the repository when creating the site with `npm create goodfellow`, this is already done. Otherwise, in `goodfellow.config.tsx`, uncomment one `backend` line and its `import`, and fill in your repository:

```tsx
import { github } from "@goodfellow-cms/github";

export default defineConfig({
  blocks,
  categories,
  backend: github({ repo: "your-name/your-site" }),
});
```

Builds include the admin panel at `/admin` only once a backend is set. If the live site is built from a branch other than the repository's default branch, add `branch: "name"`.

Also set the site's address under **Site settings → General → Site address**, including any subfolder (such as `https://your-name.github.io/your-site`). It's used for the sitemap and for link previews.

### 3. Choose a host

Each host's free plan has its own rules about business use. If the site is for a business, sells anything, shows ads, or is built or looked after by someone who's paid for it, check those rules first. As of October 2026, GitHub Pages and Vercel's free plan don't allow most of these, and GitLab Pages has no rule against them that we know of. See [Hosts and business sites](https://goodfellow-cms.github.io/goodfellow-cms/docs/hosts) in Goodfellow's README.

**GitHub Pages** (free for public repositories; not for online businesses or shops)

1. In the repository on GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
2. Push. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and publishes the site on every change and once a night. If your main branch isn't called `main`, change it in that file.

**GitLab Pages** (free, including for private projects; no rule against business sites that we know of)

1. Push. `.gitlab-ci.yml` builds and publishes the site on every change to the default branch.
2. For nightly rebuilds, add a schedule under **Build → Pipeline schedules**.
3. The site's address is under **Deploy → Pages**.

**Vercel** (works with GitHub and GitLab; the free plan is for non-commercial sites only)

1. Import the repository in Vercel. `vercel.json` already has the right settings.
2. For nightly rebuilds, create a deploy hook under **Settings → Git → Deploy Hooks**, and call it from a scheduled GitHub Action or GitLab pipeline schedule.

Delete the setup files for the hosts you don't use.

### 4. Set up sign-in

**GitHub:** nothing to set up. Editors sign in at `/admin` with an access token. The admin panel links to GitHub's token page with the right permissions already chosen. On that page, under **Repository access**, choose **Only select repositories** and pick the site.

- Editors who are collaborators on someone else's personal repository can't use that kind of token. They can use the "broader token" link instead. Alternatively, move the repository into a free GitHub organization and make editors members.

**GitLab:** editors can sign in with an access token straight away. For one-click **Sign in with GitLab**, register the admin panel with GitLab once:

1. Go to your profile's **Preferences → Applications** (or the group's **Settings → Applications**) and add an application.
2. Set:
   - **Redirect URI:** the admin panel's address with a trailing slash, such as `https://your-site.example/admin/`.
   - **Confidential:** leave this **off**.
   - **Scopes:** `api`.
3. Copy the **Application ID** into the config: `gitlab({ project: "your-name/your-site", clientId: "…" })`.

Every editor needs permission to change the repository: on GitHub, write access; on GitLab, the Developer role or higher.

## Images and files

Upload images and files on the admin panel's **Media** screen, or with the **Choose image** button wherever an image goes. They're saved in `public/media/`, and large photos are made web-sized automatically.

## Writing with AI

The admin panel's **AI** tab can draft pages, rewrite blocks and fill in news stories. Each editor picks an AI service there. Claude and some others need the editor's own API key and charge for use; there are free options, including copying the request into a chat app such as Claude.ai. To offer only some services, or to turn the assistant off, see `ai` in [Configuration](https://goodfellow-cms.github.io/goodfellow-cms/docs/configuration).

## Publishing

Each **Publish** in the admin panel saves its changes as one commit to the main branch, which starts a new build. The admin panel shows when the live site has been updated, usually within a minute or two. If someone else changed the same page in the meantime, publishing stops and explains what happened, instead of overwriting their work.
