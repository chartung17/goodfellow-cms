A block is a [Puck component](https://puckeditor.com/docs/integrating-puck/component-configuration): a React component plus the fields the editor shows for it. Add it to `blocks` in `goodfellow.config.tsx`.

```tsx
// blocks/mass-times.tsx
import { classNameField, cx } from "@goodfellow-cms/react";
import type { ComponentConfig } from "@puckeditor/core";

export interface MassTimesProps {
  times: Array<{ day: string; time: string }>;
  className: string;
}

export const MassTimes: ComponentConfig<MassTimesProps> = {
  label: "Mass times",
  fields: {
    times: {
      type: "array",
      label: "Times",
      arrayFields: { day: { type: "text", label: "Day" }, time: { type: "text", label: "Time" } },
    },
    className: classNameField,
  },
  defaultProps: { times: [{ day: "Sunday", time: "10:00 am" }], className: "" },
  render: ({ times, className }) => (
    <dl className={cx("grid grid-cols-2 gap-2", className)}>
      {times.map((item) => (
        <div key={item.day} className="contents">
          <dt className="font-semibold">{item.day}</dt>
          <dd>{item.time}</dd>
        </div>
      ))}
    </dl>
  ),
};
```

## Rules

- **Never rename** a block's key in `blocks`, or any of its props. Content files refer to blocks and props by name.
- **CSS classes:** give every block `className: classNameField` and apply it to the outermost element. Combine classes with `cx()`, with `className` last, so an editor's classes override the block's own.
- **Complete class names:** write Tailwind classes as whole strings, using lookup tables for options (`{ sm: "gap-3", md: "gap-6" }`), or Tailwind won't find them.
- **Theme classes:** style with the theme's classes, such as `bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`, `font-heading` and `rounded-lg`, rather than fixed colors, so blocks follow the site's settings.
- **Site data:** read menus, settings and collections with `useSite()`, never by copying them into props.
- **Links and images:** render them with `SiteLink` and `SiteImage` from `@goodfellow-cms/react`, not `<a>` and `<img>`, so they follow the site's base path and use `next/link` and `next/image` in Next.js. Other root-relative addresses, such as a CSS background, go through `withBase(url, useSite().base)`.
- **Media fields:** a prop holding an uploaded file's address uses `mediaField()`, which adds the media library's chooser.
- **No hooks in `render`**, other than `useSite()`: in Next.js, blocks render as Server Components. Interactive parts go in [Client Components](/docs/interactive-blocks).
- **Labels for everyone:** fields' labels and options are for people who aren't developers: "Space above and below", not "padding-y".

## Blocks for collections

In a collection's page design, Puck's `metadata` holds the item being shown (`metadata.entry`) and its collection (`metadata.collection`), for `resolveFields` and `resolveData`; `useSite().entry` has the item while rendering. Wrap blocks that only make sense there in `templateOnly()`, which leaves them out of the other editors.

A block can give the page it's on pages of its own, as Calendar does for its months and Collection list for its later pages: wrap it in `withPages(block, (props, { content, page, today }) => [...])` from `@goodfellow-cms/core`, returning each page's `suffix` (its address after the page's own, such as `page/2`), a `title` added to the page's, and what it shows (`month`, `page` or `choice`). Builds write them, and the block reads which one it's showing from `useSite().view`, when `view.block` is its own id. Only the first block on a page that adds pages gets them.

A block can also repeat the blocks inside it once for each of a collection's items, as Collection loop does: `repeatsForEntries(block, { design, items, entries })` from `@goodfellow-cms/react` names the slot that holds the design, the slot the copies go into, and a function that picks the items. The copies are made where pages are rendered, with each item's values in its placeholders, and never saved.

Custom fields don't say what they hold, so give them `metadata: { ai: … }` (an `AiFieldHint` from `@goodfellow-cms/ai`) for the AI assistant to fill them in.
