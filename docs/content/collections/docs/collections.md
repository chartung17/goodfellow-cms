A collection is a group of similar items, such as news stories, events, videos or staff. Each item is a set of fields, and every item's page shares one design, so adding an item is just filling in a form.

## Create a collection

On the **Collections** screen, click **New collection** and give it a name ("Events") and a name for one item ("Event"). Choose whether items have pages of their own, and their address, such as `/events/{slug}`, where `{slug}` is each item's name.

## Fields

Under **Settings**, choose the collection's fields:

| Type | Holds |
|---|---|
| Short text | A line of text, such as a speaker's name |
| Long text | Several lines, kept as typed |
| Formatted text | Paragraphs, headings, lists, links |
| Number | A number, such as an order or a price |
| Date | A calendar date |
| Date and time, for events | When an event starts and ends, and how it repeats (see [Calendars and events](/docs/calendars)) |
| Link | A web address, a page's address, or an uploaded file |
| Image | An image from the media library |
| Choice from a list | One of a set of choices, such as a category |

Every collection has a **Title** field. Fields can be required, have a hint for editors, and be reordered. Removing a field removes its values from every item in the same publish, and so does removing a choice.

Settings also choose the order items are listed in, such as newest first, and whether items are events that calendars show.

## The page design

**Page design** opens the editor on the page every item shares. Use the **Entry field** block to show one of the item's fields, or type a field's name in braces in any text, such as a heading reading `{title}` or a button linking to `{video}`. Blocks such as **Previous and next** and **On this page** only make sense here, so the page editor doesn't offer them.

## Items

The collection's **Items** tab lists them. Adding one (**Add Event**, say) asks for a title and a name for its address; the editor then shows the item's fields beside a preview of its page.

To show items on other pages, add a **Collection list** block, which can show them as a list or cards, newest first or upcoming only, and as many as you choose.

## Storing items as Markdown

A collection can store its items as Markdown files instead of JSON. Turn on **Store items as Markdown files** in its settings and choose which formatted-text field is the file's text; the other fields are saved at the top of the file. Changing the setting converts every item in the same publish.

Markdown is a plain-text format that developers can edit in their own tools, and review easily when it changes. In the admin panel it's edited as before, in the formatted editor, or as Markdown in the **Markdown** tab. Text the formatted editor can't show, such as a table or a picture, can only be edited in the Markdown tab, so nothing is lost. These docs are a collection stored this way.

In Markdown text, HTML is shown as text rather than run, and code blocks are highlighted:

````md
```sh
npm run dev
```
````
