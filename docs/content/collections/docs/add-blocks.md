The admin panel's **Blocks** screen adds more blocks to the editor, from Goodfellow's block registry, built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). They're listed by kind, with the recommended ones marked:

| Block | What it's for |
|---|---|
| Hero | A large heading at the top of a page, with text, buttons and a picture |
| Cards | A grid of cards, each with a picture, a heading, text and a link |
| Call to action | A highlighted box asking visitors to do something, with a button |
| Testimonials | Quotes from people, with their names and photos |
| Notice | A short message that stands out, such as a closure or a change of times |
| Pricing table | Plans side by side, with prices, what each includes and a button |
| FAQ | Questions that open to show their answers |
| Tabs | Content split into tabs, one shown at a time |
| Image carousel | Pictures shown one at a time, with buttons to move between them |

## Adding a block

**Add** and **Remove** mark blocks to add or remove; **Publish** then makes every change in one save, and **Discard changes** forgets them. Publishing writes each added block's code into the site's repository, as a developer running `npx shadcn add` would: the block goes in `blocks/installed/`, and the shadcn components it uses in `components/ui/`. The editor offers it once the site has been rebuilt, a minute or two after publishing. Like the built-in blocks, these use the site's colors, fonts and corner rounding.

FAQ, Tabs and Image carousel are interactive. The FAQ's answers and the tabs' content are in the page even when hidden, so search engines and search boxes find them.

## Removing a block

A block can't be removed while a page, a collection's page design, the header or the footer uses it; the Blocks screen lists where it's used. Removing deletes its files, except those someone has changed since it was added, or that another block still uses.

## Other registries

Developers can publish registries of Goodfellow blocks built with other component libraries; see [Block registries](/docs/block-registries). A site only offers blocks from Goodfellow's registry and the registries its developer lists, because a block's code runs in the admin panel.
