Editors sign in at `/admin` on the live site with their own GitHub or GitLab account. There's no separate list of users: anyone who can change the site's repository can edit the site, and the site's owners invite and remove them under **Site settings → Editors**.

## Inviting and removing editors

**Site settings → Editors** lists everyone who can edit the site, and the invitations they haven't accepted yet. There are two roles:

- **Editors** change and publish everything in the admin panel.
- **Owners** can also invite and remove editors, change their roles, and connect a domain.

Owners invite people by their GitHub or GitLab username, and on GitLab by email address too, in which case GitLab helps them make an account if they don't have one. The host emails each person an invitation, which they accept before they can sign in. Invitations can be withdrawn until they're accepted. Nobody can remove themselves or change their own role, so a site always keeps its owner.

- **On GitHub,** signing in can't change who edits the site, since that needs GitHub's Administration permission, which can also delete the repository. The Editors screen asks owners for a second token, an **owner token**, made from a link that fills in the permissions it needs. It's kept only until the browser tab closes, and stops working after a day. The Domain screen uses it too, for GitHub Pages settings.
- **On GitLab,** owners are Maintainers in the site's project, and editors are Developers. GitLab only lets Maintainers publish to the main branch at first, so the Editors screen offers **Let editors publish**, which lets Developers publish too, while still stopping anyone from rewriting the site's history. People in a GitLab group that has the project are listed too, but are changed in the group on GitLab.

## GitHub

Editors sign in with a personal access token. The admin panel's **Create a token on GitHub** link opens GitHub's token page with the right permissions already chosen; under **Repository access**, choose **Only select repositories** and pick the site. Paste the token into the admin panel.

Every editor needs write access to the repository. GitHub doesn't let collaborators on someone else's personal repository use these fine-grained tokens, so either:

- put the repository in a free GitHub organization and add editors as members, or
- have collaborators use the **Create a broader token instead** link, which creates a classic token.

## GitLab

With the site's application registered (see [Put it online](/docs/put-it-online#4-set-up-sign-in)), editors click **Sign in with GitLab**. Without it, or as an alternative, they sign in with a personal access token. Editors need the Developer role or higher.

## Staying signed in

Editors choose whether to stay signed in on the device (**Stay signed in on this device**; leave it off on shared computers). Otherwise the sign-in lasts until the browser tab closes. **Sign out** forgets the token, and the AI keys entered in the AI tab too.

Tokens are only ever sent to GitHub or GitLab, never anywhere else. If a token stops working, for example because it expired, the admin panel asks to sign in again.
