Automatic updates: `goodfellow update` (and `goodfellow-next update`) updates a site to Goodfellow's newest fixes, or a release it's given, with the Puck version that release uses, and updates blocks from Goodfellow's registry, replacing only files nobody changed (`planUpdate()`). It publishes the update only once the site installs and builds with it, and otherwise puts everything back. The starters' GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages setups run it each night. **Site settings → Updates** shows the site's release, fixes and newer releases, and the last update, installs fixes now, lets owners install a newer release, and on GitLab turns on job token pushes and a nightly schedule. Owners can turn automatic fixes off and go back to the previous release, which updates then skip until it's allowed again; these settings live in a new content file, `content/updates.json`. Backends gain an optional `updates` capability; the GitHub owner token can now run workflows.
