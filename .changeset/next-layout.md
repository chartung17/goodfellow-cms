The Next.js starter shows the header and footer in a layout (`app/(site)/layout.tsx`, from `goodfellowPages().Layout`), so they stay as they are when moving between pages, and pages only send their own content. `@goodfellow/react` exports `PageHeader`, `PageContent`, `PageFooter` and `prepareLayout()`. Menu marks current links with `data-current` and `aria-current`, which Next.js's layout sets in the browser, since it doesn't know the current page. In `next dev`, `withGoodfellow()` turns off React's debug channel, which made the browser's memory grow to gigabytes with the header and footer in a layout.
