Showing collections. Collection list gets a heading with a link beside it, filters by a choice or tags field, Z to A and any-field ordering, later pages (`/news/page/2`) and a page for each choice of a field (`/news/topics/music`). The new Collection loop block repeats blocks designed in the editor once for each item, with its values in placeholders such as `{title}`. Collections get a Tags field type (`tags`), for any number of a list's choices. Blocks can add pages to the page they're on with `withPages()` from `@goodfellow-cms/core`, which the Calendar block's month pages now use: `sitePages()` takes the site's blocks, and `Page.view` and `useSite().view` replace `Page.month` and `useSite().month`. `repeatsForEntries()` from `@goodfellow-cms/react` makes a block repeat its blocks for each item.
