Calendars: collections get a "Date and time, for events" field (`event`), with all-day events, end times and repeats (daily, weekly on chosen days, monthly on a date or a weekday of the month, yearly, every so often, until a date, with dates to skip), in the site's new time zone setting. A collection whose settings name its event field (`calendar`) is a calendar: builds write it as `/calendars/<id>.ics` for visitors to subscribe to, and each event as its own file. The new Calendar block shows events coming up, or a month at a time with a page for each month, from a collection, another calendar's `.ics` address (read when the site is built) or both, with "Add to calendar" and "Subscribe" links; Add to calendar does the same on an event's page. Collection list and Entry field show events' next times. New collections can start as Events. `sitePages()` lists the pages builds write, month pages included, and `goodfellow-next finish` writes calendar files into Next.js exports. Repeats are expanded, and calendar files read and written, with [ical.js](https://github.com/kewisch/ical.js).
