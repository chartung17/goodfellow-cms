Hardening from code scanning: trimming slashes and other characters no longer uses patterns that slow down on long runs of them (core's new `trimChars()`), and nor do reading SVG sizes, typed domains, link targets, heading anchors and README notes. Search results show any `<` or `>` in an excerpt as text, apart from Pagefind's highlights. Link targets decode an address's entities once, as browsers do. SVG uploads also lose `vbscript:` links and `data:` links other than images. Islands' generated module escapes `<`, `>` and line separators in names and paths.
